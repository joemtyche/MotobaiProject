- INVENTORY auto sort active top
- description box too small
- stock logs modal lacks some information maybe
- double clicking submission issue

- details modal(see information of a row onclick)
- StockLogs needs a detail view modal

Extra stuff that may or may not be implemented:

- "order again" with same items input etc.

MY QUESTIONS:
- for backend when checking, what are the common questions or tasks that the panelists do to check the backend?
- may tax pa ba?

Current Issues:
- when an order is created, so does invoice, tracking; the way it is set up is so that orderid = 1, then invoiceid, trackingid = 1; even though invoice and tacking cannot be made without an order, 
if orderid != trackingi != invoiceid is not the same then most functions will not work
- same for product -> inventory

dont mind this
  C:\Users\tyche\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313\python.exe manage.py runserver


  customRender: (item) => {
        return <p>{item.order_tracking.status}</p>;
      },

  employee -> stock in
