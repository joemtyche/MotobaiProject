MY QUESTIONS:
- for backend when checking, what are the common questions or tasks that the panelists do to check the backend? 
Current Issues:
- when an order is created, so does invoice, tracking; the way it is set up is so that orderid = 1, then invoiceid, trackingid = 1; even though invoice and tacking cannot be made without an order, 
if orderid != trackingi != invoiceid is not the same then most functions will not work
- same for product -> inventory
